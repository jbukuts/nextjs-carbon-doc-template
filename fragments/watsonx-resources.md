![notebook_card](./images/100/1-Dashboard-Notebook-Tile.png)

3. A new page with a modal menu titled **Work with data and models in Python or R notebooks** will appear. In this menu click the **URL** option in the left-hand navigation.
4. In the **Name** field type an appropriate identifier. If working in a classroom setting you'll want to prepend with your `{uniqueid}`.

> NOTE: The `{uniqueid}` value can be anything that uniquely identifies your asset from the assets of other students. Typically a last name or initials will suffice. Watsonx.ai will not prevent assets from being saved with the same name, so this will help you find the notebook later.

5. For the **Select runtime** option use `Runtime 22.2 on Python 3.10 XXS`, larger runtimes use more tokens or cloud credits.
6. To import from a URL, select the **URL** option in the left panel and populate the **Notebook URL** text box with the URL where your raw notebook file is hosted. Alternatively, to import from a local file, select the **Local file** option in the left panel and drag and drop the file from your local system to the section indicated.
7. Once all the required fields are filled, click the **Create** button. You will then be launched into the notebook.
