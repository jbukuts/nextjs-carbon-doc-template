# Welcome

This is a living example of how MDX syntax is translated into a static page within the site.

It also contains links to other documentation about the various inner workings of the site to help get a better understanding of how it works.

Out-of-the-box the template is already set up for:

- Styling for most basic HTML-Markdown analogs like:
  - Lists (Ordered and Unordered)
  - Tables
  - Headings
  - Codeblocks (with highlighting via `rehype-highlight`)
- Linting with ESLint
  - MDX/Markdown support via `eslint-plugin-mdx` and `remark-lint` plugins
- Unit testing setup with `vitest`
- SEO metadata based on frontmatter properties for:
  - OpenGraph
  - Twitter
  - JSON-LD
- Localization via `next-intl`
