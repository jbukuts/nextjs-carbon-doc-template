# Custom Components

In this document is a list of the custom components available for use within your MDX content.

All source code for these components can be found within `src/components/shortcodes`.

## Accordion

Built off of the `Accordion` components from `@carbon/react`. Some added logic exists to streamline its use.

<Accordion>
  <AccordionItem title='Code Test'>
    Here is a code block within a accordion item:

    ```py
    test = "test %s"
    print(test % "item")
    ```

  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title='Callouts'>
    Here is how a `Callout` may display
    > A basic `blockquote`

  </AccordionItem>
  <AccordionItem title='NavTile'>
    Testing how `NavTile` displays in an accordion component:
    <TileGrid>
      <NavTile to='/3-carbon' />
      <NavTile to='/4-content-sourcing' />
      <NavTile to='/5-content-loading' />
      <NavTile to='/6-localization' />
    </TileGrid>
  </AccordionItem>
</Accordion>

## Tabs

Built off the `Tabs` components from Carbon. Some built-in logic has been added to account for layers.

````md
<Tabs>
    <TabList aria-label="List of tabs">
      <Tab>Code</Tab>
      <Tab>Callouts</Tab>
      <Tab>Table</Tab>
    </TabList>
    <TabPanels>
      <TabPanel>
        Notice how it's background uses the proper layer attribute. This is automatic.
        ```ts
        const test = 'test';
        console.log(test);
        ```
      </TabPanel>
      <TabPanel>
        > A blockquote with some `code`
        <Danger text="With some text" />
        <Warning>
          And a **warning**
        </Warning>
        <QuizAlert/>
      </TabPanel>
      <TabPanel>
        Tables also account for layer depth.
        | one | two |
        | --- | --- |
        | a   | b   |
        | c   | d   |
      </TabPanel>
    </TabPanels>
</Tabs>

      const test = 'test'; 
      console.log(test); 
      ```
    </TabPanel>
    <TabPanel>
      > A blockquote with some `code`
      <Danger text='A danger item' />
      <Warning>
        And a **warning**
      </Warning>
      <QuizAlert />
    </TabPanel>
    <TabPanel>
      Tables also account for layer depth.
      | one | two |
      | --- | --- |
      | a   | b   |
      | c   | d   |
    </TabPanel>
  </TabPanels>
</Tabs>

## Tokenization Applet

The `TokenizationApplet` is an interactive component that shows off the transformation from text to tokens. It is built off of `@xenova/transformers` package which in turn is built off of Hugging Face's `transformers` package in Python.

<TokenizationApplet />

## Callouts

Callouts follow the same styling as a `blockquote` element and can be found below:

All callouts have the same props available as under the hood they make use of the `BlockQuote` shortcode just with different colors applied.

| Prop       | Type        | Description                                                              | Optional |
| ---------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| `text`     | `string`    | Text within the callout. If specified will override the `children` prop. | yes      |
| `children` | `ReactNode` | Content with the callout. Allows for nested styling.                     | yes      |

Let's take a look at each of them in action with different props applied.

### QuizAlert

`QuizAlert` is the only callout with a default value for the `text` property. This default value is also already configured to be localized. For instance:

```md
<QuizAlert />
```

<QuizAlert />

```md
<QuizAlert text="Prop testing"/>
```

<QuizAlert text='Prop testing' />

```md
<QuizAlert>
Children **testing**
</QuizAlert>
```

<QuizAlert>Children **testing**</QuizAlert>

### Warning

```md
<Warning text='Using the `text` prop with MD syntax will not **any** apply styling!'/>
```

<Warning text='Using the `text` prop with MD syntax will not **any** apply styling!' />

### Danger

```md
<Danger>
However, using MD syntax as the `children` prop will style them properly.

You can nest **_styling_** all you want.
</Danger>
```

</Danger>

```md
<Danger text="Text here">

</Danger>
```

<Danger text='Text here'>Children here</Danger>

### Persona

```md
<Persona>
For this lab you will be acting as a System Administrator
</Persona>
```

<Persona>For this lab you will be acting as a System Administrator</Persona>

### Generic

```md
<Callout>
A generic callout
</Callout>
```

<Callout>A generic callout</Callout>

### Blockquote

```md
> BlockQuote uses the standard blockquote selector `>` in Markdown. So nested styling is supported easily.
